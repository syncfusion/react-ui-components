### React Dropdown List

The Dropdown List component provides a user-friendly interface for selecting a single option from a list of predefined values. It supports rich customization, filtering, and templating features, making it ideal for forms, data filtering, and guided user selections.

**Key features**

- **Primitive Data Binding:** Bind the Dropdown List to simple arrays of strings or numbers for straightforward use cases without complex data structures.

- **Grouping:** Organize Dropdown List items into logical categories using the groupBy property, improving navigation and discoverability in large datasets.

- **Filtering:** Enable the filterable property to allow users to search and narrow down options dynamically, with real-time updates to the list as they type.

- **Grouping with Filtering:** Combine grouping and filtering to enhance usability, especially when dealing with extensive or categorized data.

- **Templates:** Customize the Dropdown List appearance using various template options:

- **Item Template:** Use itemTemplate to style individual items or display additional information.
    - **Header Template:** Add custom content at the top of the Dropdown List using headerTemplate.
    - **Footer Template:** Include extra information or actions at the bottom using footerTemplate.
    - **Value Template:** Style the selected value using valueTemplate for a personalized display.
    - **Label Mode:** Control how labels or placeholders appear with the labelMode property. Available modes include Never, Always, and Auto.
