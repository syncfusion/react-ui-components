# React Icons Library

The React Icon Library is a centralized and scalable collection of SVG-based icon components built specifically for modern React applications. Designed to offer a consistent and customizable icon experience across projects.

**Key Features**

* Includes a comprehensive set of over 500+ ready-to-use SVG icon components covering essential categories such as arrows, indicators, file types, and more.
* Icon components support dynamic props like color, size, width, height, and viewBox, enabling easy visual customization directly through JSX.
* Icons are exported as lightweight, reusable React functional components. They can be seamlessly embedded in buttons, inputs, navigation items, cards, and other custom components.
* With modular exports, only the icons used in your application are included in the final bundle, ensuring optimal performance with minimal overhead.

To install `icons`, use the following command,

```sh
npm install @syncfusion/react-icons
