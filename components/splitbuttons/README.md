# React Split Button Components

The Syncfusion React SplitButton package is a feature-rich collection of UI components, including SplitButton and DropDownButton, designed for advanced button interactions in React applications.

## Setup

To install `splitbuttons` and its dependent packages, use the following command,

```sh
npm install @syncfusion/react-splitbuttons
```

## React Split Button

The Split Button component combines a primary button action with a dropdown menu, allowing users to access additional options or actions from a compact interface, enhancing user interaction with contextual commands.

**Key features**

- **Primary and Secondary Actions:** The Split Button provides a main action on the button itself, with secondary actions available in a dropdown list, offering ease of use and efficiency in accessing commands.

- **Customization Options:** Style the Split Button with various color options like 'warning', 'success', 'danger', and 'info', and integrate icons using CSS class names or React components (SVG) to enhance visual appeal.

- **Icon Placement:** Configure the position of icons relative to button text, with options available for left, right, top, or bottom positioning, ensuring design consistency.

- **Popup Management:** Control the behavior of the dropdown popup with the `isPopupCreatedOnClick` prop for performance optimization and manage toggle states efficiently using the `toggle` prop.

- **Template Support:** Utilize the `itemTemplate` prop to customize the dropdown menu items, ensuring a tailored user experience that matches application needs.

**Usage**

```tsx
import { SplitButton } from "@syncfusion/react-splitbuttons";

export default function App() {
    const menuItems = [{ text: 'Cut' }, { text: 'Copy' }, { text: 'Paste' }];

    return (
      <SplitButton items={menuItems}>Default Action</SplitButton>
    );  
}
```

## React Dropdown Button

The Dropdown Button component enhances user interfaces with a menu of actions or options that appears on button click, offering an intuitive dropdown mechanism for users.

**Key features**

- **Color Options:** Style the dropdown button using color variants such as 'warning', 'success', 'danger', and 'info' to align with application themes.

- **Icon Customization:** Integrate icons within the dropdown button using CSS classes or React components (SVG). Adjust icon placement relative to button text with options for left, right, top, or bottom positioning.

- **Interactive Elements:** Configure the dropdown content using the `itemTemplate` prop for advanced functionality within dropdown items. Define action items and their properties for a seamless user interaction experience.

- **Responsive Design:** Adapt the dropdown button with size options — 'small' and 'large' — to fit different UI scenarios.

- **Popup Control:** The `isPopupCreatedOnClick` prop controls the dynamic creation of the popup for enhanced performance. Manage the button's open/close states with the `toggle` prop for precise control over user interactions.

**Usage**

```tsx
import { DropDownButton } from "@syncfusion/react-splitbuttons";

export default function App() {
    const menuItems = [{ text: 'Cut' }, { text: 'Copy' }, { text: 'Paste' }];

    return (
      <DropDownButton items={menuItems}>Default</DropDownButton>
    );  
}
```
