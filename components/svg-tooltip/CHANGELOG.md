### Svg Tooltip

`The SVG-based Tooltip` is a reusable, high-performance component that renders interactive tooltips using `Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)`. It provides pixel-perfect, crisp visuals even at different zoom levels and supports rich formatting, animations, and crosshair integration.

**Key features**

- Pure SVG rendering (no HTML fallback by default, ensuring consistency with the chart's SVG output).
- Customizable appearance via themes, borders, shadows, and fill opacity.
- Support for markers, headers, footers, and formatted content (text + values).
- Positioning logic relative to data points, mouse, or fixed anchors.
