## React Calendar
 
The Calendar component provides a versatile and interactive date selection interface with support for multiple views, customizations, and selection modes. It is designed to handle a wide range of scheduling and planning use cases.
 
**Key features**
 
- **View Modes:** Switch between month, year, and decade views using the start and depth properties to control the initial view and navigation depth.
 
- **Date Range Control:**  Restrict selectable dates using minDate and maxDate to ensure users can only choose valid dates within a defined range.
 
- **Custom Cell Templates:** Use the cellTemplate property to customize the appearance of specific dates, including disabling dates to prevent selection.
 
- **Week Number Display:** Enable the weekNumber property to show week numbers alongside calendar dates for better context in scheduling.
 
- **Multi-Date Selection:** Activate the multiSelect property to allow users to select multiple non-consecutive dates, ideal for marking events or selecting custom date ranges.
 
## React DatePicker
 
The DatePicker component offers a streamlined and customizable interface for selecting dates, supporting various formats, view modes, and styling options. It is ideal for forms, scheduling tools, and any application requiring precise date input.
 
**Key features**
 
- **Custom Date Formats:** Display and receive date values in formats that suit your application using the format property, which supports standard date format patterns.
 
- **Read-Only Mode:** Prevent user edits while displaying a selected date by enabling the readOnly property—useful for forms or scenarios where the date is system-generated.
 
- **View Modes:** Navigate through Month, Year, and Decade views to provide flexible date selection experiences.
